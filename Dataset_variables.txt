DATASET VARIABLES EXAMINATION:

Lookint at train.csv
	- 82 columns total
	- col 1: number of elements
	- col 82: critical temperature we want to derive

Removing first and last column (col 1 and cols 82), we're left with 80 columns.

After looking at the GitHub page for this project, and examining the tc.RData file there:

We can divide the remaining 80 columns into 8 GROUPS of 10 MEASUREMENTS.

Each GROUP is an atomic property, with 10 different methods used to measure that property:

ATOMIC PROPERTIES (8 total):
	1.	Atomic Mass
	2.	First Ionization Energy
	3.	Atomic Radius
	4.	Density
	5.	Electron Affinity
	6.	Fusion Heat
	7.	Thermal Conductivity
	8.	Valence

MEASUREMENTS (10 total):
	A.	Mean
		1.	Mean
		2.	Weighted Mean
		3.	Geometric Mean
		4.	Weighted Geometric Mean
	B.	Entropy
		5.	Entropy
		6.	Weighted Entropy
	C.	Range
		7.	Range
		8.	Weighted Range
	D.	Standard Deviation
		9.	Standard Deviation
		10.	Weighted standard Deviation
