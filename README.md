# Unlocking Superconductor Potential: Predicting Critical Temperatures with Multivariate Regression

The project's overall goal is to create a regression model to predict the Critical Temperature (Tc) of different superconducting materials.

Guiding questions:​

- What factors are the most accurate for predicting a given material's Critical Temperature (Tc)?​
- Can we use the measured properties of a given material to predict its Critical Temperature (Tc)?​
